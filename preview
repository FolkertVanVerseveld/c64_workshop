The preview was attended by the following people:

* Brian
* Dennis
* Jelle
* Sander
* Teun

One of the interesting observations was that the music intermezzo examples were
badly choosen for the C64. This became apparent when I showed an example of a
C64 sid with samples and only discussed the samples after the intermezzo.

This made the preview attendees mix up the NES compositions with the C64.
And 9 examples are a little bit too much.

I also received regular feedback from:

* Bert
* Boaz
* Kees
* Otto
* Tjaard

The following examples were played for the attendees to guess during the
preview:
1. NES uninvited main theme
2. MSDOS Xenon 2 main theme
3. C64 Rob Hubbard Warhawks
4. C64 Jeroen Tel Cybernoid I
5. MSDOS Lotus III pc speaker main theme
6. NES Jeroen Tel Robocop 3
7. C64 Jeroen Tel Robocop 3
